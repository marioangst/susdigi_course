    "text": "1.1.1 The Brundtland definition\nThis is the original (in the sense of the first widely read and most referenced) mission statement/ definition in (The World Commission on Environment and Development. 1987, Conclusion, emphasis added):\n\n\nSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts: • the concept of ‘needs’, in particular the essential needs of the world’s poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and • the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment’s ability to meet present and future needs.\nThus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in terms of sustainability in all countries\n\n\ndeveloped or developing, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will vary, but must share certain general features and must flow from a consensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a broad strategic framework for achieving it.\n\n\nDevelopment involves a progressive transformation of economy and society. A development path that is sustainable in a physical sense could theoretically be pursued even in a rigid social and political setting. But physical sustainability cannot be secured unless development policies pay attention to such considerations as changes in access to resources and in the distribution of costs and benefits. Even the narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation.\n\n\nThe Brundtland definition is still relevant today and often referenced. Often, it is reduced to the first line in point 1. above. Seeing the definition in context is helpful to recognize that intra- and intergenerational justice (especially distributive justice) has always been at the core of sustainability as a normative concept.\n\n\n1.1.2 Strong and weak sustainability\nBefore and after the Brundtlandt definition, many different variations on sustainability definitions emerged. A key, helpful way to make sense of how people talk about and define sustainability is the differentiation between strong and weak sustainability (Ott, Muraca, and Baatz 2011). On important difference between strong and weak sustainability concepts relates to the possibility of substitution:\n\n\nWe will not go into the widespread “three pillars” (variants of economy, society and nature spheres of sustainability) model here, except for noting that its foundations and origins are very unclear and shaky - and that upon closer inspection, it just continues to raise questions because of that (Purvis, Mao, and Robinson 2019).\n\nWeak sustainability concepts basically argue that “nature” (without going into nature as a concept here, which has many pitfalls) or natural capital is nothing special among other forms of capital and can be substituted at will. This is important for sustainability when considering the world that a current generation should leave to future generations. Ott, Muraca, and Baatz (2011) make the example of forests - under weak sustainability, a world without forests would be a perfectly acceptable world to leave to future generations, given that all functions of forests can be fulfilled by other means (eg. wood replacements, direct carbon capture, nature films..) and that this substitution is cost-effective (non-declining utility over time).\n\n\n\nThis notion of substitution obviously is very relevant when considering sustainability in the light of digitalization.\n\nStrong sustainability concepts are of the “nature is the foundation, not a pillar” variant and advocate that natural capital needs at least to be maintained for future generations. The argument is generally not about the possibility of substitution but its desirability and advocates of strong sustainability use arguments (among others) such as multi-functionality of the biosphere, the need to not reduce options for future generations or the precautionary principle (Ott, Muraca, and Baatz 2011, 20).\n\n\n\nIt also needs to be noted here that notions of substitution rest on very specific ways of thinking about relationships between nature and humans, which are not by any means shared across knowledge systems across the world.\n\n\n1.1.3 Three core strategies: Efficiency, sufficiency, consistency\nSustainability is an interconnected problem of distributive justice and resource use. One of the key developments of the sustainability science literature was the differentiation of three essential strategies that are possible to reduce resource use. In a simplified form:\n\nEfficiency strategies reduce the resource used per unit of output. For example, reducing the amount of energy used for a computer to compute a specific task.\nSufficiency strategies reduce the actual number of units of output to reduce resource use impact. For example, one can ask if the specific computation is actually necessary if it has an environmental impact. There is much more to the concept, as it is often connected to broader questions of what is really needed (or suffices) for a good life but we’ll keep the definition simple for our purposes here.\nConsistency strategies try to embed entire processes in natural cycles. As such, consistency is often only possible on a larger level (circular economy concepts). For example, if energy used for a computation is sourced from renewable energy sources and the hardware components making the computation possible can be recycled.\n\nThe combination of efficiency and sufficiency strategies is often refered to as twin or double decoupling (Schneidewind 2018) (as in decoupling economic activity from resource use), compared to single decoupling as used in many green growth narratives, which often only targets efficiency strategies.\n\n\n1.1.4 Sustainability imaginaries\nSustainability as a normative concept ultimately needs to be and is translated into actions, where it is needed to legitimize these actions. As such, the normative concept of sustainability can also be studied from a more sociological perspective. Various configurations of actors leverage the concept, rephrase, translate and adapt it in an ongoing discourse (Göpel 2016). In doing so, they draw up visions and imaginaries for future societal pathways.\n\n\nIt is not surprising that many sustainability scientists are obsessed with science fiction. “In a certain sense, a sustainable world is a fiction” (Martens 2006, 40). For a beautiful example of science fiction based sustainability imaginaries, see https://radicaloceanfutures.earth.\nOne interesting starting point here is the idea of ideal typical imaginaries of “futures of sustainability”, modernization, transformation and control (Adloff and Neckel 2019), which can also be considered related to digitalization (Lenz 2021). These imaginaries are not actual futures but reference points that actors can refer to in discourses.\n\nSustainability as Modernization: Based on weak sustainability concepts, sustainability as modernization describes futures the leave current capitalist economies largely untouched but reorient them to work within or solve environmental problems. Economic growth is not questioned and sustainability challenges might even be seen as a growth opportunities (“green growth”, emissions markets, Green New Deal…).\nSustainability as Transformation: Imaginaries based on transformation ideas reject the weak sustainability foundations of modernization and call for more fundamental changes in society in a “great transformation” sense. Their proponents draw up visions of a post-growth, solidarity society moving away from limitless consumption and capitalist extraction (Wiedmann et al. 2020 is a recent read).\nSustainability as Control: This imaginary is driven by ideas of resilience, inevitability and emergency. Here, powerful entities (eg. autocratic states) “solve” sustainability crises by leveraging emergency (see Patterson et al. 2021 for a nuanced discussion of emergency framings around climate change) powers to mitigate consequences of crises in possibly undemocratic ways.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Modern developments\nAmong more recent higher-level concepts shaping thinking around sustainability, three interconnected developments stand out:\n\nThe concept of planetary boundaries (Rockström et al. 2009; Steffen et al. 2015) has been hugely influential in providing a high-level heuristic to diagnose the state of the earth system with regard to being a “safe operating space for humanity”.\nThe concept of the Anthropocene (Lewis and Maslin 2015), positing a new geological epoch defined by the impact of humans on the earth has both captured and influenced thinking around sustainability, from critiques of how useful the term “environmental” still is (Biermann 2021) to fundamental reconsiderations of nature-culture dichotomies (Buscher and Fletcher 2020).\nThe concept of the doughnut economy (Raworth 2017) has been one of the more elegant ways of designing a narrative combining the planetary boundaries concept as a upper limit for human activity on the planet with a lower limit for human prosperity that should be met for all. The space inbetween is the “safe and just space for humanity”.\n\nThere is obviously much much more that has happened recently in sustainability science (Clark and Harley 2020). One more mention should probably be work on shallow and deep leverage points and their application to sustainability transformation (Fischer and Riechers 2019), which are a heuristic to think about how to intervene in complex systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the “There is obviously much much more to sustainability science” - I could not resist.

    "text": "1.2 Sustainability transformations\nSustainability transformations are the actual socio-technical change processes happening that are oriented toward sustainability. These can be studied in their own right.\n\n1.2.1 Sustainability transitions\nThe sustainability transitions literature is a lively, interdisciplinary field of research which is concerned with how radical changes toward sustainability come about in sectors that fulfill key societal functions (like energy, transport, healthcare, water/sanitation, etc.) and how they can be actively navigated by stakeholders (Truffer et al. 2022; Loorbach, Frantzeskaki, and Avelino 2017).\n\n\n1.2.2 Sustainability governance\nAnother literature coming from policy studies and social-ecological systems perspectives (in the Ostrom 2009 sense) focuses more on the processes in sustainability governance not necessarily contained to radical changes. Lubell and Morrison (2021) is a good entry point.\n\n\n1.2.3 The UN 2030 Agenda\nThe UN 2030 Agenda (United Nations General Assembly 2015) and its associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been the outcomes of a high-level political process that has developed normative power in defining areas for action on sustainability since its inception in 2015. In their conceptual foundations, the SDGs are probably closer to the “three pillars” model of sustainability in raising more questions, the closer one looks into them. Further, the goals are very broad global goals and their actual political impact beyond agenda setting (which should not be underestimated however!) appears to have been limited until now (Biermann et al. 2022).\nStill, research on the SDGs occupies a lot of space in the sustainability science literature at the moment, for example with interesting work on indicators for SDGs (Koch, Beyer, and Chen 2023), local adaptation of SDGs and their implementation (Patel et al. 2017) or SDG interactions (Bennich, Weitz, and Carlsen 2020).\n\n\n\n\nAdloff, Frank, and Sighard Neckel. 2019. “Futures of Sustainability as Modernization, Transformation, and Control: A Conceptual Framework.” Sustainability Science 14 (4): 1015–25. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-019-00671-2.\n\n\nBehringer, Jeannette. 2022. “Effizienz für Nachhaltigkeit – Notwendig, Jedoch Nicht Hinreichend.” Conexus, October, 7–28. https://doi.org/10.24445/conexus.2022.05.003.\n\n\nBennich, Therese, Nina Weitz, and Henrik Carlsen. 2020. “Deciphering the Scientific Literature on SDG Interactions: A Review and Reading Guide.” The Science of the Total Environment 728: 138405. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138405.\n\n\nBiermann, Frank. 2021. “The Future of ‘Environmental’ Policy in the Anthropocene: Time for a Paradigm Shift.” Environmental Politics 30 (1-2): 61–80. https://doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2020.1846958.\n\n\nBiermann, Frank, Thomas Hickmann, Carole-Anne Sénit, Marianne Beisheim, Steven Bernstein, Pamela Chasek, Leonie Grob, et al. 2022. “Scientific Evidence on the Political Impact of the Sustainable Development Goals.” Nature Sustainability, June, 1–6. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-022-00909-5.\n\n\nBuscher, Bram, and Robert Fletcher. 2020.

As is the regulation or non-regulation of the socio-technical consequences.\nAs such, the most important thing to note here is that the direction of digitalization but depends on its discursive construction (Marenco and Seidl 2021).

Generally, the problem with sustainable digitalization research is that there is not as much as one could expect (Andersen et al. 2021).\nHilty and Aebischer (2015, 20) proposed the Life-cycle, Enabling, Structural (LES) framework as a high-level heuristic to think about the impact of ICT on sustainability in a more structured way. Their model is helpful as a starting point as it is relatively empirical in focusing on impacts on resources use without taking a a priori stance on eg. acceptable forms of substitution Section 1.1.2.

    "text": "Life-cycle impacts refer to the direct material impacts of technology, eg. raw materials used to build hardware or electricity used in running it. These impacts have become more present in societal discourse recently as people have started realizing that something named in a deceptively ephemeral way like “cloud computing” actually relies on physical infrastructure like data centers.\nEnabling impacts refer to actions on the micro level that are made possible by ICT and can be in line or non-aligned with sustainability goals. Staying with data centers, these could be actions like streaming movies or working from home depending on virtual meetings. Three types of enabling impacts are proposed:\n\nProcess optimization is seen as a special type of substitution where immaterial resources (information at the most abstract level) substitute material resources. An interesting example given in Hilty and Aebischer (2015, 25) are route planning algorithms and hardware, which can be seen as information provision enabled by ICT to reduce energy use of travel.\nMedia substitution replaces a material with another material resource. This is more straightforward, eg. e-books replacing printed books.\nExternalization of control substitutes one immaterial with another immaterial resource. This is also a bit tricky, but a good example is a already centrally, algorithmically controlled greenhouse (implying a previous step of process optimization), which can now be controlled remotely and uses data to optimize its algorithms from other connected greenhouses.\n\n\n\n\nThe LES framework relies heavily on a distinction between material and immaterial resources (along distinctions between natural/ human-made and renewable/ non-renewable) and draws on a definition (Hilty and Aebischer 2015, 5) defining a material resource as a resource where using it affects its other uses. Eg. oil that is burnt cannot be used again to provide energy, while something like knowledge or birdsong is not consumed by using it.\n\nStructural impacts are persistent macro-level changes in economic structures and societal institutions. The LES in its original formulation was relatively thin on this but recent work on sustainable digitalization has put much more emphasis on this (eg. Digitalization for Sustainability (D4S) 2022).\n\n\n\n\nLES model, reproduced from Hilty and Aebischer (2015, 24)\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Combining the LES framework and core strategies\nMoving in a more normative direction, we can now think more about how the different core sustainability strategies see 1.1.3 can target different areas of the LES framework (Santarius and Wagner 2023).\n\n\n\n\nLife-cycle\nEnabling\nStructural\n\n\n\n\nSufficiency\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Going beyond resource use\nIn its initial conception, the LES framework is somewhat narrowly focused on resource use and thus limited with regard to some sustainability aspects. For example, the framework does not cover the distributive justice aspects of sustainability extensively, especially with regard to intra-generational justice. Such an extension seems feasible though.\n\n\nTo be fair, Hilty and Aebischer (2015, 23) state that the model does not attempt to cover all impacts and can/ should be extended.",

    "text": "3.3 Non-alignment of digitalization with sustainability goals\nWhile the LES framework offers a heuristic to think about the interplay of sustainability and digitalization in a structured way, the normatively pressing question is then: Where are the problematic areas currently, where digitalization is not aligned with sustainability?\nCurrent research on this question varies across domains, but some patterns seem to become relatively clear.\n\nOn the life-cycle impact front, massive absolute growth in ICT infrastructure and devices is leading to ever increasing environmental impacts (Freitag et al. 2021).\nIn terms of structural impacts, the digital economy is dominated by extractive business models with large social costs, which exasperate inequalities (Vallas and Schor 2020).\nFor enabling impacts, in sectors from transportation (Milakis, Arem, and Wee 2017) to logistics (Buldeo Rai, Touami, and Dablanc 2023) or in the much heralded internet of things (Hittinger and Jaramillo 2019), a key problem is that efficiency gains promised by digitalization, while real, have underwhelmed.\n\nOverall, digital technology has cemented unsustainable business-as-usual practices rather than fostering transformative changes, a recent, encompassing overview of areas where digitalization is not aligned with sustainability goals finds in the “Digital Reset” report (Digitalization for Sustainability (D4S) 2022).\n\n\nIf you ask “which sustainability”, you have been paying attention.\nOne of the key contributions of the report is the identification of key domain areas, interlocked sustainability and digitalization challenges and some normative design principles (much more focused on deep leverage points) for a “deep” sustainability transformation.\n\n\n\nFigure from Digitalization for Sustainability (D4S) (2022, 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndersen, Allan Dahl, Koen Frenken, Victor Galaz, Florian Kern, Laurens Klerkx, Matthijs Mouthaan, Laura Piscicelli, Juliet B Schor, and Taneli Vaskelainen. 2021. “On Digitalization and Sustainability Transitions.” Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions 41 (December): 96–98. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2021.09.013.\n\n\nBarth, Matthias, Maike Gossen, Daniel J Lang, and Tilman Santarius. 2023. “Sustainable Digitalization Fostering the Twin Transformation in a Transdisciplinary Way.” GAIA - Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society 32 (1): 6–9. https://doi.org/10.14512/gaia.32.S1.3.\n\n\nBuldeo Rai, Heleen, Sabrina Touami, and Laetitia Dablanc. 2023. “Not All e-Commerce Emits Equally: Systematic Quantitative Review of Online and Store Purchases’ Carbon Footprint.” Environmental Science & Technology 57 (1): 708–18. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c00299.\n\n\nChristoph Becker (Director of the Digital Curation Institute). 2023.
