              change the way individuals, communities, governments and private
              actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological change.
              Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are
              already today being applied in a number of research fields
              related to climate change and environmental monitoring.
              Investments into applications of these technologies in
              agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also
              seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and
              deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for
              sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in
              depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of
              such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for
              sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of
              marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in
              these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms;
              b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and
              external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and
              resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical
              questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance
              mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these

               sustainability concept, while avoiding a too narrow

  author   = "Purvis, Ben and Mao, Yong and Robinson, Darren",
  abstract = "The three-pillar conception of (social, economic and
              environmental) sustainability, commonly represented by three
              intersecting circles with overall sustainability at the centre,
              has become ubiquitous. With a view of identifying the genesis and
              theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews
              and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From
              this we find that there is no single point of origin of this
              three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from
              various critiques in the early academic literature of the
              economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives
              on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a
              solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the
              United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram
              appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv
              14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed
              towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern
              interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to
              predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically
              rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be
              in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising
              from broadly different schools of thought historically. The
              absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates
              approaches towards a theoretically rigorous operationalisation of
              `sustainability'.",

               integrated approaches are required to support sustainable

  author   = "Adloff, Frank and Neckel, Sighard",
  abstract = "In the last three decades, sustainability has become a guiding
              principle for states, organizations, companies, and social
              movements as well as a general ideal for social change. While
              sustainability seems to be a rather inevitable path of
              development, there is no consensus over the goals and visions of
              the future associated with this concept. Proponents of a ``Green
              Economy,'' for instance, regard economic growth as a prerequisite
              for sustainable development and advocate a modernization of
              society, which implies moderate adjustments toward a sustainable
              economy within the current institutional framework. Critics of
              this ecological modernization approach see the imperative of
              economic growth as an obstacle for sustainable development and
              instead support a fundamental transformation of society. A third
              perspective tries to solve the problems of sustainable
              development with wide-ranging politics of control, using concepts
              such as ``ecological state of emergency'' or enforcing resilience
              measures for vulnerable populations while creating safe enclaves
              for a privileged few. These three possible ideal typical
              trajectories of social change---modernization, transformation,
              and control---are not fixed yet, but rather represent different
              and highly contested imaginaries of the future. These imaginaries
              then structure distinctive practices of sustainability in the
              fields of politics, the economy, civil society, and science.
              These practices in turn are interdependent with specific
              structures, such as material infrastructures or the ecological
              system of the earth. The proposed conceptional framework uses the
              theoretical concepts of imaginaries, practices, and structures to
              study the possible futures of sustainability, specifically
              modernization, transformation, and control, as well as possible
              interdependencies between these developments. It focuses on
              sustainability as a sociological category indicative for
              understanding socioeconomic change, the emergence of new
              conflicts, inequalities, hierarchies, and justification patterns
              that result from including sustainable criteria into different
              fields, institutions, and value systems. Deciphering futures of
              sustainability does not aim at providing prognoses or forecasts,
              but intents to work out an analytical concept that asks how
              contemporary societies change when they are guided by imaginaries
              of sustainability.",

              debates, both in response to specific events and strategically.
              The strategic deployment of emergency frames by proponents of
              sustainability action aims to stimulate collective action on
              issues for which it is lacking. But this is contentious due to a
              range of possible effects. We critically review interdisciplinary
              social science literature to examine the political effects of
              emergency frames in sustainability and develop a typology of five
              key dimensions of variation. This pinpoints practical areas for
              evaluating the utility of emergency frames and builds a shared
              vocabulary for analysis and decision-making.",
