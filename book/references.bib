              change the way individuals, communities, governments and private
              actors perceive and respond to climate and ecological change.
              Methods based on various forms of artificial intelligence are
              already today being applied in a number of research fields
              related to climate change and environmental monitoring.
              Investments into applications of these technologies in
              agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also
              seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and
              deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for
              sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in
              depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of
              such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for
              sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of
              marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in
              these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms;
              b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and
              external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and
              resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical
              questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance
              mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these

               sustainability concept, while avoiding a too narrow

  abstract = "The three-pillar conception of (social, economic and
              environmental) sustainability, commonly represented by three
              intersecting circles with overall sustainability at the centre,
              has become ubiquitous. With a view of identifying the genesis and
              theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews
              and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From
              this we find that there is no single point of origin of this
              three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from
              various critiques in the early academic literature of the
              economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives
              on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a
              solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the
              United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram
              appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv
              14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed
              towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern
              interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to
              predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically
              rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be
              in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising
              from broadly different schools of thought historically. The
              absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates
              approaches towards a theoretically rigorous operationalisation of
              `sustainability'.",

               integrated approaches are required to support sustainable

  author   = "Adloff, Frank and Neckel, Sighard",
  abstract = "In the last three decades, sustainability has become a guiding
              principle for states, organizations, companies, and social
              movements as well as a general ideal for social change. While
              sustainability seems to be a rather inevitable path of
              development, there is no consensus over the goals and visions of
              the future associated with this concept. Proponents of a ``Green
              Economy,'' for instance, regard economic growth as a prerequisite
              for sustainable development and advocate a modernization of
              society, which implies moderate adjustments toward a sustainable
              economy within the current institutional framework. Critics of
              this ecological modernization approach see the imperative of
              economic growth as an obstacle for sustainable development and
              instead support a fundamental transformation of society. A third
              perspective tries to solve the problems of sustainable
              development with wide-ranging politics of control, using concepts
              such as ``ecological state of emergency'' or enforcing resilience
              measures for vulnerable populations while creating safe enclaves
              for a privileged few. These three possible ideal typical
              trajectories of social change---modernization, transformation,
              and control---are not fixed yet, but rather represent different
              and highly contested imaginaries of the future. These imaginaries
              then structure distinctive practices of sustainability in the
              fields of politics, the economy, civil society, and science.
              These practices in turn are interdependent with specific
              structures, such as material infrastructures or the ecological
              system of the earth. The proposed conceptional framework uses the
              theoretical concepts of imaginaries, practices, and structures to
              study the possible futures of sustainability, specifically
              modernization, transformation, and control, as well as possible
              interdependencies between these developments. It focuses on
              sustainability as a sociological category indicative for
              understanding socioeconomic change, the emergence of new
              conflicts, inequalities, hierarchies, and justification patterns
              that result from including sustainable criteria into different
              fields, institutions, and value systems. Deciphering futures of
              sustainability does not aim at providing prognoses or forecasts,
              but intents to work out an analytical concept that asks how
              contemporary societies change when they are guided by imaginaries
              of sustainability.",

              key dimensions of variation. This pinpoints practical areas for
              evaluating the utility of emergency frames and builds a shared

               so that it can be applied usefully in a regional
               context.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259855 INTRODUCTION
               There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the
               continued development of human societies and the maintenance of
               the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state.
               The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a
               paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that
               human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary
               scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework
               are updated and strengthened. RATIONALE The relatively stable,
               11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that
               we know for certain can support contemporary human societies.
               There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting
               ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the
               ES\textbackslashtextemdashits ability to persist in a
               Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures
               and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that
               regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific
               understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary
               principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic
               perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES
               is likely to remain low\textbackslashtextemdasha
               \textbackslashtextquotedblleftsafe operating
               space\textbackslashtextquotedblright for global societal
               development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the
               area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic
               impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES,
               is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
               RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone
               depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged
               from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as
               globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere
               integrity (earlier \textbackslashtextquotedblleftbiodiversity
               loss\textbackslashtextquotedblright), biogeochemical flows,
               land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one
               regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for
               atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a
               single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances,
               new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that
               have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological
               effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their
               potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the
               PBs\textbackslashtextemdashclimate change and biosphere
               integrity\textbackslashtextemdashare recognized as
               \textbackslashtextquotedblleftcore\textbackslashtextquotedblright
               PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The
               climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution,
               and net balance of energy at Earth\textbackslashtextquoterights
               surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in
               the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual
               change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES
               processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity,
               biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the
               proposed PB (see the figure). CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically
               based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES
               functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the
               PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene
               state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB
               framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These
               are political decisions that must include consideration of the
               human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB
               framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space
               for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable
               contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses
               for societal development. Current status of the control
               variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone
               is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of
               uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone.
               The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the
               green and yellow zones. The control variables have been
               normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure
               therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control
               variables. The control variable shown for climate change is
               atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level
               boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray
               wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities,
               and the functional role of biosphere integrity. The planetary
               boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity
               based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the
               stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the
               planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning
               biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert
               research communities and on more general scientific advances
               over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a
               two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale
               interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the
               processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core
               boundaries\textbackslashtextemdashclimate change and biosphere
               integrity\textbackslashtextemdashhave been identified, each of
               which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system
               into a new state should they be substantially and persistently
               transgressed.",

               model of development. The good news is that conservation is
               ready for revolution. Heated debates about the rise of the
               Anthropocene and the current `sixth extinction' crisis
               demonstrate an urgent need and desire to move beyond mainstream
               approaches. Yet the conservation community is deeply divided
               over where to go from here. Some want to place `half earth' into
               protected areas. Others want to move away from parks to focus on
               unexpected and `new' natures. Many believe conservation requires
               full integration into capitalist production processes. Building

               protected areas and faith in markets to incorporate the needs of
               humans and nonhumans within integrated and just landscapes.

               studies on the Sustainable Development Goals published between
               2016 and April 2021. Our findings suggests that the goals have
               had some political impact on institutions and policies, from
               local to global governance. This impact has been largely

              limits of using new data for monitoring urban sustainability and
              especially the Sustainable Development Goals.The latest debate on
              smart cities and sustainability is underpinned by the United

              Development Goals (SDGs), which place urban data and monitoring
              systems at the forefront. Therefore, there is a strong need to
              assess the data-driven capabilities that will help achieve the

              depends on the availability and accessibility of robust data, as
              well as the reconfiguration of governance systems that can
              catalyse urban transformation. Given the uneven success of the
              Millennium Development Goals, and the unprecedented inclusion of
              the urban in the SDG process, the feasibility of SDG 11 was
              assessed in advance of its ratification through a series of urban
              experiments. This paper focusses on Cape Town's participation in
              piloting SDG 11, in order to explore the role of urban
              experimentation in highlighting the partnership arrangements
              necessary to allow cities to meet the data and governance
              challenges presented by the SDG 11. Specifically, we focus on the
              relationship between data and governance that lie at the heart of
              the SDG 11. The urban experiment demonstrates the highly complex
              and multi-level governance dynamics that shape the way urban
              experiments are initiated, executed and concluded. The
              implications of these dependencies illustrate that more attention
              needs to be paid at the global level to what data are important
              and how and where the data are generated if SDG 11 is to be met.
              Overall, this paper makes the case that the success of SDG 11

  abstract = "The 2030 Agenda includes 17 overarching Sustainable Development
              Goals (SDGs). These are integrated in nature, and a principle of
              indivisibility should guide their implementation. Yet, the 2030
              Agenda itself does not provide guidance on what indivisibility
              means in practice, how the SDGs interact, or on how to assess
              these interactions. The fast-emerging field of what could be
              referred to as SDG interaction studies seeks to provide such
              guidance, but as of yet there is no general agreement on what it
              means to take an integrated approach to the SDGs. Hence,
              navigating the diverse research landscape on SDG interactions
              might prove challenging. This paper aims to decipher the
              literature on SDG interactions by providing an overview of the
              current research, based on a sample of 70 peer-reviewed articles.
              The review explores four themes in SDG interaction research by
              mapping: (i) policy challenges typically addressed, (ii) ways in
              which SDG `interactions' have been conceptualized, (iii) data
              sources used, and (iv) methods of analysis frequently employed.
              Research gaps are identified, where perspectives largely missing
              include policy innovation, and integrated monitoring and
              evaluation. Further, few studies consider actor interactions,
              account for geographic spill-overs, analyze SDG indicator
              interactions, employ participatory methods, or take a
              whole-systems approach to the 2030 Agenda. Failing to address
              these gaps could lead to inefficient SDG implementation and delay
              goal attainment. Another contribution of the paper is a reading
              guide, proposing a way to decipher the literature along the
              themes emerging from the review, and offering a structure to code

              on discourse analysis of the digitalization agenda in Swedish

              phase of the emerging policy and planning area of digitalization
              and smart mobility. It examines and critically discusses the
              current discursive framing of digitalization in current transport
              policy and planning, and considers perspectives and meanings
              related to ``smart'' mobility and accessibility that are being
              established in strategic plans and policies for the Swedish
              transport sector. The empirical focus is on transport strategies
              and official reports developed at national level. The main
              findings indicate that digitalization is being framed as a rapid,
              unstoppable transformation process, which will lead to a range of
              positive outcomes such as reduced climate emissions, less
              congestion, improved accessibility, and a smoother and more
              resource-efficient transport system. According to the ideas and
              assumptions promoted in the current discourse, this
              transformation can only occur through stronger involvement of
              business enterprises. This governing strategy, or lack of
              governing strategy, makes it unclear how transport policy
              objectives are balanced against market and innovation interests.
              It also risks delegating the transition to sustainable mobility
              to less formalized and less transparent policy arenas that
              operate in parallel to, and partly outside, established planning
              and strategy-making processes.",

              repertoires in the discursive practicing of digitalization:
              everyone-else, speed, competition, job loss, control, safety, and
              equality. Examining their functions and effects, we show that not
              only is digital transformation constructed as more productive,
              efficient, competitive, technologically advanced, safe, and
              equal, it also involves a shift towards the blue-collar worker
              being more vulnerable; a construction where she is able-minded
              but lonely, physically fragile, obtuse and unreliable, and a
              victim of a development beyond her control, forcing of her to
              acquire new competence. We conclude that this reproduces
              asymmetrical power relations between workers and companies,
              pushing the challenges of digital transformation to the workers.
              At the same time, we also see how these local discourses hold a
              possibility of tempering this asymmetry through the construct of
              togetherness of different contexts, bodies, and hierarchal

               the daily lives of billions of people worldwide. At the same
               time, the current economic model and consumerist lifestyle needs
               to be radically transformed if society is to overcome the
               challenges humanity is facing on a finite planet. Can the
               much-discussed disruption potential of digitalization be
               harnessed for this purpose? Smart Green World? provides guiding
               principles for a sustainable digital society and develops
               numerous hands-on proposals for how digitalization can be shaped
               to become a driving force for social transformation. For
               instance, the authors explain why more digitalization is needed
               to realize the transition towards 100\% renewable energy and
               show how this can be achieved without sacrificing privacy. They
               analyze how the information revolution can transform consumption
               patterns, mobility habits and industry structures -- instead of
               fostering the consumption of unneeded stuff due to personalized
               commercials and the acceleration of life. The authors reveal how
               Artificial Intelligence and the Industrial Internet of Things
               pose novel environmental challenges and contribute to a
               polarization of income; but they also demonstrate how the

               taking priority and society at large reaping the benefits of
               technological change in a most democratic way. Providing a
               comprehensive and practical assessment of both social and

               platform work and the underlying metaphors associated with each.
               Platforms are seen as entrepreneurial incubators, digital cages,
               accelerants of precarity, and chameleons adapting to their
               environments. Each of these devices has limitations, which leads
               us to introduce an alternative image of platforms: as permissive
               potentates that externalize responsibility and control over
               economic transactions while still exercising concentrated power.
               As a consequence, platforms represent a distinct type of
               governance mechanism, different from markets, hierarchies, or
               networks, and therefore pose a unique set of problems for
               regulators, workers, and their competitors in the conventional
               economy. Reflecting the instability of the platform structure,
               struggles over regulatory regimes are dynamic and difficult to

               findings discussed in literature about those effects are
               reviewed and areas for future research are identified. The
               structure of our review is based on the ripple effect concept,
               which represents the implications of automated vehicles at three
               different stages: first-order (traffic, travel cost, and travel
               choices), second-order (vehicle ownership and sharing, location
               choices and land use, and transport infrastructure), and
               third-order (energy consumption, air pollution, safety, social
               equity, economy, and public health). Our review shows that
               first-order impacts on road capacity, fuel efficiency,
               emissions, and accidents risk are expected to be beneficial. The
               magnitude of these benefits will likely increase with the level
               of automation and cooperation and with the penetration rate of
               these systems. The synergistic effects between vehicle
               automation, sharing, and electrification can multiply these
               benefits. However, studies confirm that automated vehicles can
               induce additional travel demand because of more and longer
               vehicle trips. Potential land use changes have not been included
               in these estimations about excessive travel demand. Other
               third-order benefits on safety, economy, public health and
               social equity still remain unclear. Therefore, the balance

              years, the environmental impact of e-commerce can still be
              considered a controversial subject. Particularly for those
              wondering whether online shopping constitutes a more
              environmentally friendly alternative to traditional store-based
              shopping, evidence can be found that quantitatively supports
              affirmative as well as opposing claims. Findings differ widely

              they are drawn differ widely as well. To advance our
              understanding of this question and inform actions that can
              actually reduce the environmental impact of shopping, we carried
              out a systematic quantitative review of environmental impact
              assessments that compares the carbon footprint of online and

              purchases, but only in the case of car-dependent lifestyles, and

  author    = "Fischer, Joern and Riechers, Maraja",
  abstract  = "Abstract Drawing on seminal work by the late Donella Meadows, we
               propose a leverage points perspective as a hitherto
               under-recognized heuristic and practical tool for sustainability
               science. A leverage points perspective focuses on places to
               intervene in complex systems to bring about transformative
               change. A leverage points perspective recognizes increasingly
               influential leverage points relating to changes in parameters,
               feedbacks, system design and the intent encapsulated by a given
               system. We discuss four key advantages of a leverage points
               perspective. First advantage: A leverage points perspective can
               bridge causal and teleological explanations of system change ?
               that is, change is seen to arise from variables influencing one
               another, but also from how human intent shapes the trajectory of
               a system. Second advantage: A leverage points perspective
               explicitly recognizes influential, ?deep? leverage points ?
               places at which interventions are difficult but likely to yield
               truly transformative change. Third advantage: A leverage points
               perspective enables the examination of interactions between
               shallow and deep system changes ? sometimes, relatively
               superficial interventions may pave the way for deeper changes,
               while at other times, deeper changes may be required for
               superficial interventions to work. Fourth advantage: A leverage
               points perspective can function as a methodological boundary
               object ? that is, providing a common entry point for academics
               from different disciplines and other societal stakeholders to
               work together. Drawing on these strengths could initiate a new
               stream of sustainability studies, and may yield both practical
               and theoretical advances. A plain language summary is available
