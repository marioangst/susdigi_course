# Sustainability

A key distinction to be made when discussing sustainability is the distinction between:

- Sustainability as a normative concept, including its discoursive contestation and imaginaries
- Sustainability *transformations* as socio-technical change process oriented toward sustainability

For German readers, Jeannette Behringer gives a very concise general introduction to many classic sustainability concepts in @Behringer2022-iv

## Sustainability as a normative concept

### The Brundtland definition

This is the original (in the sense of the first widely read and most referenced) mission statement/ definition in [ @The_World_Commission_on_Environment_and_Development1987-fx, Conclusion, point 1, emphasis added]:

> 1. Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:
  • the concept of 'needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority
should be given; and
  • the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's
ability to meet present and future needs. 
2. Thus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in terms of sustainability in all countries
- developed or developing, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will vary, but must share certain
general features and must flow from a consensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a
broad strategic framework for achieving it.
3. Development involves a progressive transformation of economy and society. A development path that is
sustainable in a physical sense could theoretically be pursued even in a rigid social and political setting. But
physical sustainability cannot be secured unless development policies pay attention to such considerations as
changes in access to resources and in the distribution of costs and benefits. *Even the narrow notion of physical
sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be
extended to equity within each generation*.

The Brundtland definition is still relevant today and often referenced. Often, it is reduced to the first line in point 1. above. Seeing the definition in context is helpful to recognize that *intra- and intergenerational justice* (especially distributive justice) has always been at the core of sustainability as a normative concept.

### Strong and weak sustainability

Before and after the Brundtlandt definition, many different variations on sustainability definitions emerged. A key, helpful way to make sense of how people talk about and define sustainability is the differentiation between strong and weak sustainability [@Ott2011-gl]. On important difference between strong and weak sustainability concepts relates to the possibility of substitution:

::: {.column-margin}
We will not go into the super-widespread "three pillars" (variants of economy, society, nature) model here, except for noting that its foundations and origins are very unclear and shaky - and that upon closer inspection, it just continues to raise questions because of that [@Purvis2019-ox].
:::

- Weak sustainability concepts basically argue that "nature" (without going into nature as a concept here, which has many pitfalls) or natural capital is nothing special among other forms of capital and can be substituted at will. This is important for sustainability when considering the world that a current generation should leave to future generations. @Ott2011-gl make the example of forests - under weak sustainability, a world without forests would be a perfectly acceptable world to leave to future generations, given that all functions of forests can be fulfilled by other means (eg. wood replacements, direct carbon capture, nature films..) *and* that this substitution is cost-effective (non-declining utility over time).

This notion of substitution obviously is very relevant when considering sustainability in the light of digitalization.
:::

- Strong sustainability concepts are of the "nature is the foundation, not a pillar" variant and advocate that natural capital needs at least to be maintained for future generations. The argument is generally not about the possibility of substitution but its desirability and advocates of strong sustainability use arguments (among others) such as multi-functionality of the biosphere, the need to not reduce options for future generations or the precautionary principle [@Ott2011-gl, p. 20].

::: {.column-margin}
It also needs to be noted here that notions of substitution rest on very specific ways of thinking about relationships between nature and humans, which are not by any means shared across knowledge systems across the world.

### Sustainability as a discoursively contested concept

Sustainability as a normative concept ultimately needs to be and is translated into actions, where it is needed to legitimize these actions. As such, the normative concept of sustainability can also be studied from a more sociological perspective. Various configurations of actors leverage the concept, rephrase, translate and adapt it in an ongoing discourse. In doing so, they draw up visions and imaginaries for future societal pathways.

::: {.column-margin}
It is not surprising that many sustainability scientists are obsessed with science fiction. "In a certain sense, a sustainable world is a fiction" [@Martens2006-di, p. 40]. For a beautiful example of science fiction based sustainability imaginaries, see <a href="https://radicaloceanfutures.earth">https://radicaloceanfutures.earth</a>.
:::

One interesting starting point here is the idea of ideal typical imaginaries of "futures of sustainability", modernization, transformation and control [@Adloff2019-my], which can also be considered related to digitalization [@Lenz2021-rl]. These imaginaries are not actual futures but reference points that actors can refer to in discourses.

- Sustainability as Modernization: Based on weak sustainability concepts, sustainability as modernization describes futures the leave current capitalist economies largely untouched but reorient them to work within or solve environmental problems. Economic growth is not questioned and sustainability challenges might even be seen as a growth opportunities ("green growth",  emissions markets, Green New Deal...).

- Sustainability as Transformation: Imaginaries based on transformation ideas reject the weak sustainability foundations of modernization and call for more fundamental changes in society in a "great transformation" sense. Their proponents draw up visions of a post-growth, solidarity society moving away from limitless consumption and capitalist extraction [@Wiedmann2020-rk is a recent read].

- Sustainability as Control: This imaginary is driven by ideas of resilience, inevitability and emergency. Here, powerful entities (eg. autocratic states) "solve" sustainability crises by leveraging emergency [see @Patterson2021-cl for a nuanced discussion of emergency framings around climate change] powers to mitigate consequences of crises in possibly undemocratic ways.
