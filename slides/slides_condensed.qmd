# Hello

## Resources

Online booklet with minimal content summaries/ further reading and complete sources:

<https://marioangst.github.io/susdigi_course/>

## Me

Mario Angst

Lead sustainability.discourses project @ DSI, Co-Lead DSI Community Sustainability

Past: 🌊,🌲,🌾,⚡,(🛢) governance

Now: 🏙️ and 🖥️+🍀

polsci, susci, comp socsci methods (mostly network analysis, NLP, Bayesian modeling)

Biased toward strong sustainability, bikes and local solutions.

## Goals

- You are exposed to the core components of sustainability as a normative concept
- You are aware of some existing frameworks to think in a structured way about relating digitalization and sustainability transformations
- I get to talk a little bit about sustainability imaginaries and where to find them

# Sustainability as a normative concept

## A key differentiation

-   Sustainability as a normative concept, including its discoursive contestation and imaginaries
-   Sustainability transformations as socio-technical change processes oriented toward sustainability

## The Brundtland definition

This is *the text ©️*

Take 2 minutes to read the text from "Our common future" (1989) in front of you

Take care, this is quite radical stuff

## The Brundtland definition

intra- and intergenerational justice is front and center

> Even the narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation.

but there were/ are many other sustainability definitions

## Making sense of sustainability definitions {.smaller}

It all comes down to substitution of natural capital for future generations

-   weak sustainability: substitution is ok given function is retained and utility non-declining

-   strong sustainability: natural capital needs to be at least maintained

    -   multi-functionality of biosphere
    -   option space of future generations
    -   precautionary principle

🤯 Beware of "nature" 🍃

## What about the three pillars?

We don't talk about the three pillars

## What about the UN 2030 Agenda?

-   Outcome of a political process
-   Anyone remember the Millenium Development Goals? The Agenda 21?
-   Conceptually weak, normatively... powerful? Evidence is mixed.

# Three core strategies

So sustainability is an interconnected problem of distributive justice and resource use. Three strategies everyone should be aware of in order to reduce resource use:

-   efficiency
-   sufficiency
-   consistency

## Decoupling

... (economic) activity from resource use

-   single decoupling: green growth narrative, often efficiency only
-   double decoupling: efficiency + sufficiency

# Sustainability imaginaries

> "In a certain sense, a sustainable world is a fiction" (Martens 2006, 40):

-   Modernization
-   Transformation
-   Control

## Modernization

weak sustainability, "green growth"

## Transformation

strong sustainability, post-growth, solidarity economy

![https://radicaloceanfutures.earth/](img/backfromthebrink_simonstalenhag.png)

## Control

resilience, inevitability and emergency

powerful entities solve crises with emergency powers

# Sustainable digitalization

## Starting point: The LES framework

- *L*ife cycle impacts
- *E*nabling impacts
- *S*tructural impacts

## Life cycle impacts

Actual material impacts

- Production and disposal
- Operating the infrastructure

Data center example: Energy, land...

## Enabling impact

- New actions that are enabled by digitalization (or prevented)

Three types of enabling impacts regarding resources:

- Process optimization: Immaterial replaces material resource (information reducing travel impacts)
- Media substitution: material replaces material resource (e-book, physical books)
- Externalization of control: immaterial replaces immaterial (eg. centralizing a previous process optimization step)

## Structural impact

Persistent macro-level changes in:

- economic structure
- societal institutions

## LES x core strategies bingo


|             | Life-cycle | Enabling | Structural |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Sufficiency |            |          |            |
| Efficiency  |            |          |            |
| Consistency |            |          |            |

## Sustainable digitalization imaginaries

- Remember?
  - Modernization: weak sustainability, green growth
  - Transformation: strong sustainability, solidarity economy, post-growth
  - Control: emergency, inevitability, powerful entities "solve"
  
# Where I get to talk about finding narratives
