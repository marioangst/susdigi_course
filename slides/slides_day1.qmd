Past: üåä,üå≤,üåæ,‚ö°,(üõ¢) governance

Now: üèôÔ∏è and üñ•Ô∏è+üçÄ

Computational Social Science (mostly network analysis, NLP, Bayesian modeling)

Biased toward strong sustainability, bikes and local solutions.

## Day 1 - Learning goals

-   The students can differentiate between sustainability as a normative concept and socio-technical sustainability transformations.

-   The students are aware of the three core sustainability strategies

-   The students are able to access current sustainability science literature.

## Day 1 - Program

-   Introduction to the course
-   Input sustainability
-   Break
-   Input digitalization
-   Deep dive into sufficiency: Guest speaker Leonard Creutzburg
-   Sustainability in research and teaching at UZH: Guest speaker Jeannette Behringer

## Day 2 - Program

-   Input sustainable digitalization
-   How does my research relate?
-   Build your own sus+digi project

# Sustainability as a normative concept

## Sustainability

We'll count to two.

If you are one: Introduce yourself to your neighbour to the right. Discuss (in pairs) for 7 minutes:

*What does sustainability mean to you?*

Be prepared to introduce your neighbour and what sustainability means to them afterwards.

## A key differentiation

-   Sustainability as a normative concept, including its discoursive contestation and imaginaries
-   Sustainability transformations as socio-technical change processes oriented toward sustainability

## The Brundtland definition

Worth studying for a bit.

Take five minutes to read through this. This is *the text ¬©Ô∏è*

Does anything surprise you? Discuss with your neighbor to the left (for ones) and be prepared to share your thoughts.

## The Brundtland definition

intra- and intergenerational justice is front and center

but there were/ are many other sustainability definitions

## Making sense of sustainability definitions {.smaller}

It all comes down to substitution of natural capital for future generations

-   weak sustainability: substitution is ok given function is retained and utility non-declining

-   strong sustainability: natural capital needs to be at least maintained

    -   multi-functionality of biosphere
    -   option space of future generations
    -   precautionary principle

ü§Ø Beware of "nature" üçÉ

## What about the three pillars?

We don't talk about the three pillars

## Three core strategies

So sustainability is an interconnected problem of distributive justice and resource use. Behold the three strategies everyone should be aware of in order to reduce resource use:

-   efficiency
-   sufficiency
-   consistency

## Strategy game

We'll form four groups.

We will take ten minutes to gather as many examples of:

-   behaviours
-   policies
-   business models
-   research projects

you can associate with one of the four strategies.

## Decoupling

... (economic) activity from resource use

-   single decoupling: green growth narrative, often efficiency only
-   double decoupling: efficiency + sufficiency

## Sustainability imaginaries

Things become more sociological.

Futures of sustainability. "In a certain sense, a sustainable world is a fiction" (Martens 2006, 40):

-   Modernization
-   Transformation
-   Control

## Modernization

weak sustainability, "green growth"

## Transformation

strong sustainability, post-growth, solidarity economy

![https://radicaloceanfutures.earth/](img/backfromthebrink_simonstalenhag.png)

## Control

resilience, inevitability and emergency

powerful entities solve crises with emergency powers

## What is your imaginary?

Take a walk with your neighbour to the right (for ones). Be back in twelve minutes. Prepare to share your thoughts with the group.

## Modern sustainability science concepts

-   Planetary boundaries

-   Doughnut economics and post-growth

-   The Anthropocene

-   honorable mention: leverage points

## Planetary boundaries {.smaller}

## Doughnut economics

![https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/](img/doughnut.png)

## The Anthropocene

... questions everything.

![](img/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg)

nature-culture dichotomies

is there an "environment"?



## Leverage points

How to intervene in complex systems?

![Fischer and Riechers, p. 117](img/leverage_points.png)

# Sustainability transformations

Understanding the socio-technical change processes.

## Sustainability transitions

How do radical changes happen in specific, large socio-technical systems?

## Sustainability transitions

![EEA 2019, based on Geels (2006)](img/transitions.png)

## Sustainability governance

-   Social-ecological systems perspective

-   Institutional navigation

## SES

![Ostrom 2014](img/ses.png)

## Institutional navigation

![Lubell and Morrison 2021, p. 665](img/inst_nav.png)

## The UN 2030 Agenda

-   Outcome of a political process
-   Anyone remember the Millenium Development Goals? The Agenda 21?
-   Conceptually weak, normatively... powerful? Evidence is mixed.

## SDG research

-   Indicators
-   Local adaptation
-   SDG interactions

# Break

15 minutes

# Digitalization

For our purposes: Socio-technical consequences of digitization, the conversion of analogue streams of information into digital form

## The discoursive construction of digitalization

Argument: What and how to digitize is always a decision, as well as regulation and non-regulation of its socio-technical consequences.

Why do we digitize? Let's discuss.

## For next week

Pick two of the reading materials referenced at any point in the online booklet accompanying the course at <https://marioangst.github.io/susdigi_course/>.

Read them and be prepare to share your thoughts on it.
