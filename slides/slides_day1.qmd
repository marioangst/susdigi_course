-   The students are aware of the three core sustainability strategies.

-   The students are aware of existing frameworks to relate digitalization to sustainability transformations.

- The students are aware of current research on (non-)alignment of digitalization with regard to sustainability goals.

-   The lecturer communicates course content clearly without going off on too many tangents.

# Sustainability as a normative concept

## Group exercise

We'll form groups of four by counting to $\frac{n}{4}$ in the group.

Sit together with people sharing your number.

*What does sustainability mean to you?*

You do *not* need to prepare or share anything after.

## A key differentiation

-   The *discoursively contested* normative concept. Or concept*s* with their associated social configuration of actors involved in discourse.
    -   Strong vs. weak sustainability
-   The socio-technical transformation oriented toward the concept.

## The Brundtland definition

“Environment” is where we all live; and “development” is what we all do in attempting to improve
our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable.... Humanity has the ability to make development
sustainable: to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs. (3, pp. ix, 8)

## Modern sustainability science concepts

-   Planetary boundaries
-   Doughnut economics and post-growth
-   The Anthropocene and social-ecological systems
-   The UN Agenda 2030

# Sustainability transformations

## Transformation

-   In the Polanyi sense.
-   Socio-technical

## Many transformations
