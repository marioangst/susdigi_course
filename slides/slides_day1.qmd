## Day 2 - Program

-   What could be solutions?
-   How does my research relate?

# Sustainability as a normative concept

## Group exercise

We'll form groups of four by counting to $\frac{n}{4}$ in the group.

Sit together with people sharing your number.

*What does sustainability mean to you?*

You do *not* need to prepare or share anything after.

## A key differentiation

-   The *discoursively contested* normative concept. Or concept*s* with their associated social configuration of actors involved in discourse.
    -   Strong vs. weak sustainability
-   The socio-technical transformation oriented toward the concept.

## The Brundtland definition in context

## Modern sustainability science concepts

-   Planetary boundaries
-   Doughnut economics and post-growth
-   The Anthropocene and social-ecological systems
-   The UN Agenda 2030

# Sustainability transformations

## Transformation

-   In the Polanyi sense.
-   Socio-technical

## Twin decoupling

## Many transformations
