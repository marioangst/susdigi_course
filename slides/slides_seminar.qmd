# Hello

## Resources

Online booklet with minimal content summaries/ further reading and complete sources:

## Me

Mario Angst

Lead sustainability.discourses project \@ DSI, Co-Lead DSI Community Sustainability

Past: 🌊,🌲,🌾,⚡,(🛢) governance

Now: 🏙️ and 🖥️+🍀

polsci, susci, comp socsci methods (mostly network analysis, NLP, Bayesian modeling)

Biased toward strong sustainability, bikes and local solutions.

## Goals

-   You are able to review core components of sustainability as a normative concept
-   You are aware of some existing frameworks to think in a structured way about relating digitalization and sustainability transformations
-   I get to talk a little bit about sustainability imaginaries in digitalization

# Sustainability as a normative concept

## A key differentiation

-   Sustainability as a normative concept, including its discoursive contestation and imaginaries
-   Sustainability transformations as socio-technical change processes oriented toward sustainability

## The Brundtland definition {.smaller}

> Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (...)

*intra- and intergenerational justice is front and center*

> Even the narrow notion of physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation.

but there were/ are many other sustainability definitions

## Making sense of sustainability definitions {.smaller}

It all comes down to substitution of natural capital for future generations

-   weak sustainability: substitution is ok given function is retained and utility non-declining

-   strong sustainability: natural capital needs to be at least maintained

    -   multi-functionality of biosphere
    -   option space of future generations
    -   precautionary principle


# Three core strategies

So sustainability is an interconnected problem of distributive justice and resource use. Three strategies everyone should be aware of in order to reduce resource use:

-   efficiency
-   sufficiency
-   consistency

# Sustainable digitalization

## Starting point: The LES framework

-   *L*ife cycle impacts
-   *E*nabling impacts
-   *S*tructural impacts

## Life cycle impacts

Actual material impacts

-   Production and disposal
-   Operating the infrastructure

Data center example: Energy, land...

## Enabling impact

-   New actions that are enabled by digitalization (or prevented)

Three types of enabling impacts regarding resources:

-   Process optimization: Immaterial replaces material resource (information reducing travel impacts)
-   Media substitution: material replaces material resource (e-book, physical books)
-   Externalization of control: immaterial replaces immaterial (eg. centralizing a previous process optimization step)

## Structural impact

Persistent macro-level changes in:

-   economic structure
-   societal institutions

## LES x core strategies

|             | Life-cycle | Enabling | Structural |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Sufficiency |            |          |            |
| Efficiency  |            |          |            |
| Consistency |            |          |            |


# Sustainability imaginaries

> "In a certain sense, a sustainable world is a fiction" (Martens 2006, 40):

-   Modernization
-   Transformation
-   Control

## Modernization

weak sustainability, "green growth"

![https://radicaloceanfutures.earth/](img/fishinc_simonstalenhag.png)

## Transformation

strong sustainability, post-growth, solidarity economy

![https://radicaloceanfutures.earth/](img/backfromthebrink_simonstalenhag.png)

## Control

resilience, inevitability and emergency

powerful entities solve crises with emergency powers

## Sustainable digitalization imaginaries {.smaller}

-   Modernization: weak sustainability, green growth
    -   Examples: AI for sustainability, Smart Sustainable Cities
-   Transformation: strong sustainability, solidarity economy, post-growth
    -   Open source movements, right to repair, neo-luddism
-   Control: emergency, inevitability, powerful entities "solve"
    -   Examples: Surveillance and ecological credit scores, Earth system geoengineering

# Let's talk

-   What is your sustainable digitalization imaginary?
-   Which imaginary will we get?
-   Where does your research fit in?
-   Sustainable practices in your life as a researcher (I have some ~~thoughts~~ opinions)
-   (...)
